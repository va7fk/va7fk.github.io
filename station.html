<h3>What happened to the aesthetics of amateur radio?</h3>
<p>While audio quality and signal processing of radio has never been better, most contemporary amateur equipment suffers from a lack of attention to aesthetics. Current generation SDR based transceivers with touch screens and deep menu trees look ugly and are years behind the curve in terms of user interface, pixel density, and display options. For these reasons I prefer monochrome LCD displays and equipment designed with an emphasis toward physical controls over menu driven options. This generally means sourcing gear designed between 1990 - 2012. Having an on-board band scope is nice but it's not worth the compromises and ugliness.</p>
